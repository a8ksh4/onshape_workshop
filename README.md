# onshape_workshop
Materials for a 1 month onshape workshop learning how to make models for 3d printing.

## Week 1 - Getting started and Sketching Basics
Introduce Onshape: create accounts, navigate interface (view, pan, zoom), start a Part Studio

Cover foundational sketch tools: rectangle, circle, constraints, dimensions

Demonstrate a simple extrusion to form a 3D shape

**Study Work**

**Assignment**

Create two simple extruded shapes (e.g., a box and a cylinder) with precise dimensions and show both a front and top view.
Save and share the document for review next session.

## Week 2
Build on Week 1 by introducing more sketch features: extrude, cut, holes, fillets, and chamfers

Demonstrate editing sketches and part features

**Study Work**

* Sections 01, 02, 05

**Assignment**

Model a simple functional object (e.g., a phone stand or keychain) incorporating at least one hole and one fillet or chamfer.
Export the part as an STL file, ready for 3D printing.

## Week 3
Introduce assemblies: inserting parts into Assembly studios and basic mating (planar, revolute)

Demonstrate editing sketches and parameters to adjust model dimensions

**Assignment**

Create two interlocking parts (e.g., a simple clip or bracket system)â€”use sketches with variables/parameters so dimensions can be adjusted before exporting.

Assemble both parts in an assembly and experiment with adjusting parameter values.

## Week 4
